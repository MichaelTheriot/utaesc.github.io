<h2>National Association of Engineering Student Councils</h2>
<p>The National Association of Engineering Student Councils (NAESC) is a nationwide organization composed of more than 50 schools from all over the country that strives to improve the engineering educational experience by creating a network of communication among the different ESC organizations nationwide. The organization plays a vital role in nurturing and developing leaders in engineering, who later on go on to play major roles in their fields upon graduation. NAESC regional and national conferences attract industry-leading companies from all engineering fields, resulting in great networking opportunities with prospective employers. These conferences are a great way to meet new people and make friends across the country.</p>
